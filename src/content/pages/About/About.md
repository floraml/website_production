Flora Loughridge holds a Masters in the History of Art with Distinction from the Courtauld Institute of Art, London, where she specialised in German Modernism: Architecture and Design, and was Reviews Editor of The Courtauldian publication. 

She graduated from Durham University in 2017 with a degree in German and English Literature, and is currently working as a Research Consultant on national museum redevelopment projects, including Hidden Histories at the Museum of Oxford and Courtauld Connects at the Courtauld Gallery and Courtauld Institute of Art. 

Flora joined Ideal Spaces Working Group in 2019, driven by her strong research interest in modern architecture, utopian constructs and the complex relationship between people and space. She has developed innovative research ideas and a creative marketing strategy, whilst also contributing to the 2020 group exhibition on ‘Community and Place’ at the Schusev State Museum of Architecture, Moscow. 

Since 2020, Flora has been an official gallery guide at Tate Modern, London, developing inclusive public tours that focus on the sensory experience of art.
