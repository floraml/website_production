## Museum of Oxford

### Access & Engagement at the New Museum

> Oxfordâ€™s Hidden Histories will see the transformation and expansion of the current spaces at the Museum of Oxford. The new museum will have improved and contemporary galleries, exploring new themes and stories, a new welcome area and gift shop, a Museum Makers area, learning space and full accessibility. The aim is to remove the intrusive 1970s building work, and restore the Victorian grandeur of the Grade II listed Town Hall, in which the museum is housed.

As Consultant on this exciting project, I have been conducting research to support the Museum Development Officer explore the following areas:

-	Interpretation and signage
-	Setting up an Access Advisory Group
-	Collecting data and information on programming around extending access in museums e.g. quiet openings for visitors with Autism and audio described tours

I recently supported the Museum of Oxford team in designing and delivering a focus group to gain user feedback on the museum's online collecting platform 'City Stories'. Through the City Stories website, visitors can discover interesting objects and stories submitted by members of the Oxford community and its twin cities, on themes including Sporting Oxford and the Covid-19 Pandemic. Users can also submit their own entries. Having identified key areas of the website that could be improved, we explored:

-	Accessibility
-	Navigation
-	Formatting
-	Interactive features such as the City Stories Map
-	Specific pages, including Get Started and Features
-	Browsing tools

The focus group provided us with some very useful feedback and insight into how users currently use and experience City Stories, and has given us a clear set of ideas about how to proceed in improving the website for future use.
