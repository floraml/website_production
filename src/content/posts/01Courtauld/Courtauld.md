# It may comfort you to know that Fry's death took only fifteen seconds, yet the pain was so intense, that it felt to him like fifteen years. And it goes without saying, it caused him to empty his bowels.

I'm a thing. Who said that? SURE you can die! You want to die?! Fry, we have a crate to deliver. That's a popular name today. Little "e", big "B"?

I didn't ask for a completely reasonable excuse! I asked you to get busy! What kind of a father would I be if I said no? When I was first asked to make a film about my nephew, Hubert Farnsworth, I thought "Why should I? __ Then later, Leela made the film.__ *But if I did make it, you can bet there would have been more topless women on motorcycles.* Roll film!

## Morbo can't understand his teleprompter because he forgot how you say that letter that's shaped like a man wearing a hat.

Well, then good news! It's a suppository. Hey, tell me something. You've got all this money. How come you always dress like you're doing your laundry? But I've never been to the moon! If rubbin' frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey I don't wanna be right.

1. You won't have time for sleeping, soldier, not with all the bed making you'll be doing.
2. Oh, all right, I am. But if anything happens to me, tell them I died robbing some old man.
3. I'll get my kit!

### In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up! Besides, these are adult stemcells, harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their stemcells.

I love you, buddy! Who's brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere? Hey, guess what you're accessories to. It's okay, Bender. I like cooking too.

* Interesting. No, wait, the other thing: tedious.
* Kif, I have mated with a woman. Inform the men.
* So, how 'bout them Knicks?

We need rest. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised. No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires! In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up! Besides, these are adult stemcells, harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their stemcells.

Is the Space Pope reptilian!? Oh, you're a dollar naughtier than most. Hello, little man. I will destroy you! Oh, you're a dollar naughtier than most.

Look, everyone wants to be like Germany, but do we really have the pure strength of 'will'? We'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go home. In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up! Besides, these are adult stemcells, harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their stemcells.

Oh right. I forgot about the battle. Well, let's just dump it in the sewer and say we delivered it. I meant 'physically'. Look, perhaps you could let me work for a little food? I could clean the floors or paint a fence, or service you sexually?

Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun! I'm sure those windmills will keep them cool. Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets? It may comfort you to know that Fry's death took only fifteen seconds, yet the pain was so intense, that it felt to him like fifteen years. And it goes without saying, it caused him to empty his bowels.

They're like sex, except I'm having them! I am Singing Wind, Chief of the Martians. I've been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the pope? Oh right. I forgot about the battle.

Why am I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun? Oh yeah, good luck with that. One hundred dollars. I haven't felt much of anything since my guinea pig died. As an interesting side note, as a head without a body, I envy the dead.

Of all the friends I've hadâ€¦ you're the first. Anyhoo, your net-suits will allow you to experience Fry's worm infested bowels as if you were actually wriggling through them. I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness.

I videotape every customer that comes in here, so that I may blackmail them later. Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that! There's only one reasonable course of action now: kill Flexo! Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn't make sense. But, okay!

No, she'll probably make me do it. Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar. Is today's hectic lifestyle making you tense and impatient? She also liked to shut up!

The alien mothership is in orbit here. If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards. Checkmate. I don't want to be rescued. I was having the most wonderful dream. Except you were there, and you were there, and you were there!
