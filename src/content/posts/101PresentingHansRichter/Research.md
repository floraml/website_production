Tate’s online Stay at Home Series started in March 2020 at the beginning of lockdown, with the aim of keeping members of the Tate Guides Team connected whilst the galleries were closed to visitors. The series quickly became an opportunity to learn about new artists, genres and periods unrelated to the Tate collection, with guides presenting on a diverse range of topics and artists every Wednesday and Thursday.

Keen to contribute, I decided to present my Masters dissertation research on the German filmmaker and artist Hans Richter, which, up until that point, only my dissertation supervisor had read. My findings remained hidden away in various computer files, photos and PDF documents, so it was a good excuse to revisit my notes and find new material in amongst the numerous items archived in Dropbox the year before. 

In my talk, I explore Richter’s early work, including his 1917-18 wartime drawings, scroll drawings, and selected examples of his 1920s abstract films. The cyclical nature of his work – as seen in the recurring examples of rhythm and musical counterpoint throughout his life-long artistic career – arguably became Richter’s most profound rhythm, and was a key factor in his work becoming so groundbreaking, and influential to those who knew him.
