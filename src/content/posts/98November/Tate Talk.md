### Frida Kahlo, The Two Fridas, 1939

For the recent Self-Portraits presentation series, I choose to talk about Frida Kahlo’s iconic double self-portrait <i>The Two Fridas</i> (1939). This painting very powerfully conveys many of the key themes that came to define Kahlo’s work, and in particular, speaks of the emotional and physical suffering she experienced throughout her life.

Kahlo is very well known for her self-portraits – she made approximately 70 in total, many of which reference the long periods of isolation Kahlo endured as she lay in bed recovering from surgery and illness. She once reflected: 

> 'I paint self-portraits because I am so often alone, because I am the person I know best.'

This comment reveals Kahlo’s vulnerability, but it does not in my opinion suggest that she was helpless. As we will see in the examples I show throughout this presentation, Kahlo was able to regain a certain amount of control through painting; it gave her freedom – the limitless realms of the imagination allowed her, metaphorically speaking, to leave the confines of her sick bed, and to confront what it meant to be an individual, to be a woman, to be mixed race and of course, to be a someone who had suffered a great number of injuries as an adolescent.

In 1925, when she was just 18 years old, Kahlo was involved in a near-fatal bus accident on her way home from school. She suffered many injuries, including a fractured pelvis and broken spine. This horrific accident sparked Kahlo’s life-long fascination with the universal cycle of life and she used self-portraiture as means of searching for harmony between dualistic principles, such as life and death. In <i>The Two Fridas</i>, Kahlo presents herself in two halves, as two figures separate but at the same time connected – and in this photograph, we have a third figure present: Frida Kahlo herself, standing alongside her self-portrait, which, in my opinion, draws attention to the self-referential nature of her work, which was so often a reflection of her individual, biographical perspective.

Self-portraiture became Kahlo’s principal way of expressing the discomfort she felt about exploring her own personality. Her 1944 self-portrait <i>Broken Column</i> portrays what is arguably Kahlo’s frankest expression of herself following her accident; after spinal surgery, Kahlo was forced to wear a steel body brace, which she wore for the rest of her life. In this painting, we see her body divided into two pieces by an Ionic column (which were often built for Greek and Roman goddesses) – and yet, the column, which takes the place of her damaged spine, does not stand tall and strong but looks as if it might crumble at any given moment. The corset appears to keep her body supported but at the same time confines Kahlo’s movement. We would perhaps expect to see a face full of pain or suffering, and yet Kahlo’s face appears mask-like – she looks almost stoic and her blank expression seems to conceal the intense pain we know she suffered. We see a similar emptiness reflected in the cleft in her torso and in the barren landscape pictured behind her.

Kahlo was fascinated with ‘identity’ and ‘masquerade’; we see in many of her self-portraits that there is very little variation in her expression. So, we as the viewer are often required to interpret or ‘de-code’ the symbols that Kahlo includes in her paintings – from the teardrops and red ribbons to the nails that we see in this painting, which puncture her flesh and may well be associated with the religious iconography of martyrdom. 
Returning then to <i>The Two Fridas</i>, we are faced here too with figures that have a mask-like expression; they appear both powerful and unflinching. It is our task as viewers to unravel the complex web of symbolic objects and visual cues that in order to understand the deeper meanings and intense range of emotions that are bubbling beneath the surface.

The 2018 Frida Kahlo exhibition at the V&A Museum gave a really fresh perspective on Kahlo’s compelling life story, showing a range of her personal belongings, many of which were locked away for 50 years after her death. It is helpful to put this self-portrait into context by taking a closer look at Kahlo’s heritage and upbringing, as her fascination and discomfort towards her personal ‘identity’ was deeply connected to her dual heritage – yet another example of the ‘divisions and dichotomies’ that were so important in Kahlo’s work.

Her mother was a Mexican mestiza (which in this case refers to Kahlo’s mother’s mixed heritage – she was of Spanish and Mexican Indian descent). Kahlo’s father was a German Mexican photographer - Kahlo often used her self-portraits as a means of scrutinising her mixed race heritage. I think her self-portraits also raise important questions about the Mexican society that she grew up in and the construction of identity within it, with particular reference to gender race and social class: in essence, ‘What did it mean to be Mexican?’ Perhaps we can return to this question in our discussion slightly later on.

Some art historians have suggested that the two figures in <i>The Two Fridas</i> represent Kahlo’s divided loyalties: on the one hand to the indigenous culture of her native Mexico, and on the other to Europe. The figures are identical except for the clothes they wear – one figure in white referencing a European-style Victorian dress, a stiff high-collared dress buttoned up to the chin, the kind of outfit Kahlo wore before she married the prominent Mexican painter, Diego Rivera in 1929, and the other on the right showing how with Diego’s encouragement, she came to really embrace attire rooted in Mexican customs – here we see her wearing a traditional Tehuana dress. And yet, even though the two Fridas sit apart and represent different cultures and eras, they are holding hands – as if to say that they are connected. After all, they are the two parts that make up Kahlo’s identity, and together, they show a unity and resilience in spite of the suffering Kahlo endured, which was not only caused by her physical ailments but also by the hurt and pain of her tumultuous relationship with her husband Diego, which was riddled with infidelities and jealousy. 

It is often thought that <i>The Two Fridas</i> is a bookend to her earlier 1931 portrait <i>Frieda and Diego Riviera</i>, which was made two years after their marriage in celebration of their union. However, the tentative grasp of hands, Frida’s unsmiling expression and averted eyes undercuts the celebratory nature of the occasion. Even the tone of the words written on the banner above: ‘Here you see us, me Frieda Kahlo, with my dearest Diego Rivera. I painted these pictures in the delightful city of San Francisco California for our companion Mr Albert Bender, and it was in the month of April of the year 1931' seem incredibly flat and matter of fact. I’ve often wondered why Frida is spelt with ‘ie’ here, perhaps referencing the German word ‘frei’, which means ‘freedom’, which seems rather ironic, given the misgivings she seems to show here about her husband’s fidelities.

<i>The Two Fridas</i> was made shortly after the couple divorced in 1939 and shows similar tension between attachment and detachment. The couple in both paintings hold hands and appear unified, but upon closer inspection, we wonder whether they are in fact emotionally much further apart. 

For example, if we look closely, we can see in <i>The Two Fridas</i> that Frida on the right is holding a miniature portrait of Rivera, which is connected to the arterial supply from her heart, as if it were feeding the portrait as she pines after her lost love. Like in her earlier 1931 portrait <i>Frieda and Diego Riviera</i>, Diego appears to dwarf Frida; she is placed in the role of wife of the great artist Diego Rivera, rather than a great artist in her own right. The small oval frame seems to trap her in this role, just like she was confined by her steel corset.

Then we have Frida on the left, who clamps down on this tie between Kahlo and Rivera figuratively and literally with a hemostat, a tool used to clamp an artery to control bleeding, the evidence of which we can see here in the scarlet droplets on Kahlo’s crisp white dress. I read this as the innocence of young single Frida becoming tarnished by the blood lost over of a chaotic and unpredictable marriage, but I would be interested to hear your thoughts on this later on.

<br/>
Again we see a series of divisions and opposites play out: where one of the Fridas is weakened by an exposed heart and uncontrollable bleeding, the other remains strong; the Frida that clamps down on the artery in an attempt to stem the bleeding and regain control of the situation she finds herself in, is mirrored by the Frida that seems weakened by the divorce and lost love. The uncertainty and mixed emotions we see in this self-portrait are surely a microcosm of an incredibly complex relationship, which progressed within just a few years, from marriage to divorce, to re-marriage. It is difficult to say whether the two versions of Fridas we see here are polar opposites, two halves of a unified whole, or maybe even both. When writing about this painting, Kahlo suggested that it represented a memory of an imaginary friend, who stayed with her throughout her life, doing all the things that Kahlo wanted to do ever since she was diagnosed with Polio aged six – once again, we see the dichotomy of freedom vs constraint, which Kahlo explored in <i>The Broken Column</i>.

Through it all, the two parts of Kahlo (the two Fridas) clasp their hands tightly, showing a strong bond and support system, as we see the suffering of a heart, vulnerable and laid bare to us the viewer. Perhaps this draws on Kahlo’s interest in Aztec imagery, in particular the tradition of human sacrifice, whereby Aztec priests would slice open the chests of sacrificial victims and offer their still-beating hearts to the gods. And of course, we see here, Kahlo’s heart not only exposed, but violently torn from her chest.

Blood, for Kahlo, was often used as a metaphor for union, as we see in her 1936 family portrait; her lineage is symbolised by the deep red blood vessels, which connect Frida to her parents and grandparents. In other works by Kahlo, blood was also used to portray raw violence, scenes that forced the viewer to become eyewitnesses to horrific events, such as the rape scene she depicts in her 1935 oil painting <i>A Few Little Pricks</i>. 
Interestingly, I think we see both a tenderness and violence in Kahlo’s depiction of blood in <i>The Two Fridas</i> – it is a shocking and unsettling depiction of raw emotion.

In January 1940, <i>The Two Fridas</i> was exhibited at the International Surrealist Exhibition in Mexico City. Kahlo’s work has often been described as Surrealist due to its fantastical or mystical quality, where figures such as <i>The Two Fridas</i> appear suspended in a dream-like or other-worldly environment. Interestingly, Kahlo always resisted the idea that her work was Surrealist, stating:

> ‘They thought I was a Surrealist, but I wasn’t. I never painted dreams. I painted my own reality.’

I think this is a perfect summary of <i>The Two Fridas</i>. Of course, the viewer is required to engage with symbolic imagery in order to interpret and fully understand the work, but I feel that this self-portrait is so deeply rooted in Kahlo’s lived reality – the anguish and physical suffering that she endured throughout her life  – that it would be a huge generalisation to say that it was just a dream or a scene that she had imagined.

For me, this is an uncompromising work that is indicative of the direct and dynamic quality of Kahlo’s paintings. I really enjoy its ambiguity and the process of unpicking the different strands of meaning, the divisions and dichotomies that make up Kahlo’s understanding of her personal identity.
