# Bring her forward!

The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water, signifying by divine providence that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur. That is why I am your king. And the hat. She's a witch!

No, no, no! Yes, yes. A bit. But she's got a wart. Well, what do you want? Burn her! Look, my liege! Ni! __Ni!__ *Ni!* Ni!

## Shut up! Will you shut up?!

What a strange person. Well, what do you want? We shall say 'Ni' again to you, if you do not appease us. I don't want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough water! I fart in your general direction! Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries! Now leave before I am forced to taunt you a second time!

1. Look, my liege!
2. Well, how'd you become king, then?
3. We want a shrubbery!!

### I have to push the pram a lot.

Why? Oh, ow! No, no, no! Yes, yes. A bit. But she's got a wart. Oh! Come and see the violence inherent in the system! Help, help, I'm being repressed!

* Well, I got better.
* You don't vote for kings.
* Listen. Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government. Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.

No, no, no! Yes, yes. A bit. But she's got a wart. But you are dressed as one… You can't expect to wield supreme power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you! Well, Mercia's a temperate zone!

Shh! Knights, I bid you welcome to your new home. Let us ride to Camelot! Camelot! Now, look here, my good man. Well, Mercia's a temperate zone!

Where'd you get the coconuts? Well, how'd you become king, then? I'm not a witch. He hasn't got shit all over him. Ah, now we see the violence inherent in the system!

We want a shrubbery!! I don't want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough water! I fart in your general direction! Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries! Now leave before I am forced to taunt you a second time!

What a strange person. Shut up! Will you shut up?! Did you dress her up like this? Shut up! Will you shut up?!

We found them. I have to push the pram a lot. Why do you think that she is a witch? Ni! Ni! Ni! Ni! The swallow may fly south with the sun, and the house martin or the plover may seek warmer climes in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land.

Well, what do you want? I have to push the pram a lot. I don't want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough water! I fart in your general direction! Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries! Now leave before I am forced to taunt you a second time!

I don't want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough water! I fart in your general direction! Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries! Now leave before I am forced to taunt you a second time! Camelot!

The nose? Be quiet! A newt? Shut up! Will you shut up?! Be quiet! How do you know she is a witch?

Bring her forward! We shall say 'Ni' again to you, if you do not appease us. He hasn't got shit all over him. Now, look here, my good man. Now, look here, my good man.

The nose? We found them. …Are you suggesting that coconuts migrate? The Knights Who Say Ni demand a sacrifice! Well, Mercia's a temperate zone!
