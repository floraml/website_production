## Trees of Life

The Ideal Spaces team recently launched the first booklet in a new illustrated series. The theme is 'Trees of Life'.

> The Tree of Life is an archaic symbol present in many cultures. In our Western cultural sphere, it dates back to ancient Mesopotamia, and in the Garden of Eden, it was one of two principal trees. It is the world tree, the axis mundi as a cosmic symbol, which stands for unity in diversity. Its branches symbolize the heavens, its trunk the earth and its roots the underworld. Often seen alongside the fountain of life, the tree represents life in all its forms: its spiritual, material as well as emotional and psychological aspects.

The booklet is available to order on Amazon in Paperback or Kindle edition.
