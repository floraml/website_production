Despite the influence of his pioneering concepts of abstraction and rhythm on modernist approaches to filmmaking, German artist and filmmaker Hans Richter – the subject of my Masters dissertation – has been largely understudied in secondary literature. Perhaps this is partly due to the fact that as an émigré artist, Richter lived and worked in many different countries throughout his lifetime, leaving behind numerous and disparate artistic traces that are often difficult to piece together. Whilst Richter formed a series of close encounters with artists and artistic circles throughout his career, putting him in touch with a rich and ever-changing cultural landscape, he often chose to work in parallel to movements and ‘isms’ (such as Dadaism, Cubism and Surrealism) – to carve his own unique method of working that resisted pre-established rules made by other artists.

During my initial search for information about Richter, I came across the Hans Richter Archive at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, a collection that contains a wealth of material about this somewhat elusive artist, ranging from newspaper clippings and press releases, to manuscripts, correspondence, and tape recordings. Whilst I had unlocked what seemed to be treasure trove of potentially fascinating material, the contents of the 21 archive boxes remained wholly mysterious; the generic title of each listed item concealing information that could have a profound impact on my work.

Due to the time restraints of researching and writing my Masters dissertation within a few months, I employed a research assistant to visit the Hans Richter archives in New York on my behalf. Only a few weeks later, I found my Dropbox folder slowly fill with photos of Richter’s letters, articles and photographs, all taken by my assistant Paula, a History of Art student at Columbia University. Through a careful process of decoding Richter’s sprawling handwriting and piecing together a complex chain of letters written between eminent artists of the day (such as Man Ray, Fernand Leger, Mies van der Rohe and Peggy Gugenheim – to name but a few), I started to get a clearer glimpse of Richter’s personal life, and moreover, a snapshot of the zealous artistic spirit that had impelled him to make his first, incredibly ambitious *Rhythmus* films in the early-1920s.

Towards the end of the project, I came across a photograph of Hans Richter standing in front of his ten individually framed 1919 *Preludium* drawings at an exhibition. I contacted Erik de Bourbon-Parme, curator of the Hans Richter Estate, to ask if he knew when and where the *Preludium* photograph had been taken. A few weeks later, Erik was back in touch - whilst looking through a large book of drawings by Hans Richter, entitled “Opera Grafica dal 1902 al 1969”, he had found my answer – ***Preludium* 1919 and Hans Richter at DADA SHOW Düsseldorf, 1958.** This striking black and white photograph was a rare find, as the book contained so few photographs published as enlarged negatives, and not many of these had captions. And yet it seemed to perfectly illustrate a key turning point in Richter’s artistic career, when he shifted his attention away from static, framed drawings, and instead started working within the elongated format of 4 meter long scrolls – the precursor to his work in film.

Erik explained that Richter had started selecting images and preparing text for this book in June 1975, intending to reconstruct the development of his work from 1902 till 1969. However, when Richter passed away in February 1976, the book had to be finished with the help of his wife, and art historians Roberto Sanesi, Glan Franco Berti and Magdolo Mussio. 
In an archival storage unit, located one hour outside of Florida, there are over 1300 photos and countless negatives and slides that once belonged to Richter, as well as his correspondence and carbon copy replies from his later years – these items and documents are likely to contain information that could once again change how he is perceived in the world of art history, but for now, most of them remain elusive items – hidden away and waiting to be rediscovered.
