## Courtauld Connects

### Collaborating on Phase 2: the Courtauld Institute of Art

Courtauld Connects is a multi-million-pound two-phase development that will transform the Courtauld Gallery (Phase 1), and teaching, learning and social spaces at the Courtauld Institute of Art, Somerset House (Phase 2). The project will make The Courtauld’s artworks, research and teaching accessible to more people – in the UK and internationally.

I have been involved in Phase 2 of Courtauld Connects since August 2019. This phase of the project addresses the design, use and accessibility of academic and research spaces at the Courtauld Institute, which is housed within the North Wing of Grade I listed building Somerset House.

As Research Consultant, I collaborate with the Project Team, Design Team (architects and specialist designers) and external consultants in redeveloping academic spaces, including the Courtauld Library, Research Forum, Student Hub and Lecture Theatre. An important aspect of my role is to research the current best practices in design and programming at comparable academic institutions, using benchmarking to pinpoint innovative ideas, facilities or practices. Meeting with staff at a range of London libraries and arts organisations, such as the British Library and Wellcome Collection, has given me greater insight into the practicalities of running comparable facilities, insider knowledge of effective or ineffective design practices, staff and user feedback, and a look and feel for different research or academic spaces.

Each of these factors forms a crucial part in a broader option appraisal exercise, intended to determine the most valuable and innovate use of space and research facilities at The Courtauld. In addition to collating results and writing detailed summary reports, I share my research findings during collaborative workshops with architects and specialist designers, contributing creative solutions to possible difficulties in access or design.

### The Impact of COVID-19 

The focus of my research has become much broader in the wake of Covid-19. With its devastating impact on the arts, the pandemic has, amongst many other things, forced staff and visitors to re-evaluate how they interact in a gallery or research setting. For museums and galleries currently undergoing redevelopment, such as The Courtauld, Covid-19 has introduced a new set of parameters that demand even greater attention to safety and wellbeing. 

I was commissioned by the Project Director to undertake a written report on the impact of COVID-19 on UK heritage organisations. My report summarised quantitative trends in visitor attraction surveys, such as BVA BDRC, and qualitative data on staff/visitor feedback. I conducted web-based research, consulting over 30 museum and gallery websites and focusing on the following areas:

•	Changes in services and facilities
<br>
•	Exhibitions and display changes
<br>
•	Use of technology and interactives
<br>
•	Pre-arrival, arrival and post-visit information
<br>
•	Signage and visitor flow
<br>
•	Staffing and volunteer programme changes
<br>
•	Cleaning and hygiene

I am keen to continue supporting arts and heritage organisations in forming a rapid and dynamic response to the effects of COVID-19 in a rapidly changing global situation.
