## Trees of Life

The Ideal Spaces team recently launched the first booklet in a new illustrated series. The theme of the booklet is Trees of Life, which can be considered the epitome of an ideal space - an ultimate space representing a cosmos, in which different living forms co-exist in harmony. 

> The Tree of Life is an archaic symbol present in many cultures. In our Western cultural sphere, it dates back to ancient Mesopotamia, and in the Garden of Eden, it was one of two principal trees. It is the world tree, the axis mundi as a cosmic symbol, which stands for unity in diversity. Its branches symbolize the heavens, its trunk the earth and its roots the underworld. Often seen alongside the fountain of life, the tree represents life in all its forms: its spiritual, material as well as emotional and psychological aspects.
