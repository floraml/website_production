### Honesty and repulsion

Tracey Emin’s *My Bed* is an iconic work of art that most, if not all of you are probably familiar with. It is known to divide opinion, but today I’ll be giving you my own take. When I first saw *My Bed* at Tate Britain in 2015, I was 18 years old and it must have been the first time I had seen Emin’s work. I remember standing there thinking: ‘Wow, that’s not what you’d expect to see in an art gallery.’ And I remember also feeling quite impressed that an artist could get away with putting something as normal as a bed on display, and to display it in such a state – at Tate Modern of all places! 

I didn’t necessarily warm to the installation; if anything, I felt pretty repulsed by the strewn cigarette butts, stained underwear, condoms, contraceptives and twisted bed sheets on display. It was a real mess and I remember getting a faint whiff of cigarette smoke when I stood up close. But I liked the fact that it shocked me; it wasn’t the kind of artwork I was used to seeing, so in some ways, I felt a certain admiration for what Emin had achieved.

Above anything else, I respected her brutal honesty, as, I’m sure many of you know, this installation was the result of a depressive phase Emin went through following a bad break-up, when she spent four days in bed. When she finally left her bed after this period and examined the mess she had made, she realised almost instantly that she had created a work of art. She says that as she stood there, she could envision the bed in a white space in a gallery setting. And in this moment of realisation, she could also envision a way out of her bleak situation, a way to escape this domestic environment that had become associated with thoughts of suicide, alcoholism and failure. And so the bed became a time capsule of Emin’s past. It was one of the first times that the art world had seen an artist so emphatically endorse the idea that life can imitate art.

The daring quality and relatability of Emin’s bed make many visitors feel uncomfortable; people dislike being exposed to such an extreme and raw display of real life; some critics have even described Emin’s bed as self-centred. It is no surprise that Emin’s installation has become incredibly controversial over the years; there was particular outrage when the work was nominated for the Turner Prize in 1999.

Back in 2015, I too had felt uncomfortable coming face-to-face with such a difficult time in Emin’s life, although I liked how different Emin’s work was to anything I had seen before, and how effective *My Bed* was in provoking different responses in me: surprise, repulsion, excitement and admiration.

### Perfect pairings?

But having reflected a little more deeply on the context in which *My Bed* is exhibited, my opinion has changed. I find it interesting that Emin has chosen to display her bed alongside works by other artists over the years. In fact, in 2015, Tate openly invited Emin to pair *My Bed* with any artworks in the Tate Collection. Emin chose two paintings by Francis Bacon, as she considered there to be an interesting dialogue between the intensity and anger in his work and the way her bed has a sense of collapse and seems completely forlorn. Bacon’s work is not static; it has movement, and so does the bed in many ways. It twists and turns, much like the folds and rolls of flesh of many of the people depicted in Bacon’s paintings, or indeed the waves that resemble a river in his 1961 painting *Reclining Woman*.

In Dog (1952), pictured below, we see a dog trapped within a hexagon-like shape and spinning around within its own space. Bacon deliberately smears the paint on the canvas to show the dog’s demented movement as it desperately tries to escape. I suppose we can read something similar of the situation Emin found herself in during those bed-ridden days. Bacon uses a bright, blood red paint, which speaks to the intensity of Emin’s situation and creates a close link with the emotional and physical trauma experienced by her during this period.

However, for a work that is so deeply personal as Emin’s bed, I find it strange that the moment of intimacy shared between the artwork and viewer in the gallery space is shared with a third party – Francis Bacon, in this case. I find it problematic that as I stood in the gallery in 2015, my eye was drawn to the alluring colours and scenes unfolding in Bacon’s paintings, rather than focusing purely on the highly distressing, personal bed scene in front of me. Surely this was not an appropriate invitation to extend to other artists.

In 2017, Emin’s bed was shown alongside a rich and evocative painting by J.M.W. Turner, which depicts the Kent coast from Folkestone Harbour to Dover. Below, we see Emin standing alongside her bed and a similar painting by Turner, *A Rough Sea* (c.1840-5).

Whilst I understand the importance of drawing connections between artists and artworks – which is of course what we aim to do as Tate Guides – I feel there is something slightly forced about Emin projecting her own truths and personal story onto the story and lifestyle of other artists, such as Bacon and Turner. There is one thing a critic or art historian creating these associations from a neutral point of view, but in my opinion, there is something quite awkward and displeasing about an artist making these comparisons themselves.

I felt this even more strongly when reading an interview Emin gave in 2017, where she said:

>‘I’m really pleased how Turner’s work and the bed relate to each other. I mean, we all know Turner was a really raunchy man. He was full of a lot of fecundity and action, and so am I, or used to be, so I think it’s quite nice.’

There is surely something rather presumptuous about Emin’s description of Turner’s state of mind here, and how this relates to her own former state of mind – she is drawing parallels and conclusions, almost it seems for the purpose of bolstering her own work and affirming its importance alongside eminent artists such as J.M.W. Turner and William Blake. And perhaps this was Emin’s aim – to draw away from her own personal story, and instead, to highlight the feelings of vulnerability and loneliness that are experienced by many people, of which some would come face to face with her work. Emin once said: 

>‘Basically, I’m just exposing [your] own lives, in an even more extreme way. Everybody has had a stain in their life to some degree, I’m just saying it’s OK. It’s all right. And if people want to argue with me about that then they’ve got to sort out their own lives.’

I admire Emin for sharing her personal story without any attempt to cover up or distort the truth, but I find her statement here, again, provocative and rather presumptuous. She is now not only projecting her story onto other artists, but also the *visitors* that step into the room, saying that if they feel uncomfortable, their repulsion or rejection must surely reflect their own failure to accept the difficulties in their lives. 

So the more I read into the work, the more I disliked what I saw. The objects I had at first considered to be rather moving, being the ghostly traces of Emin’s former life, now seemed false, hollow and pretentious. 

I suppose this has made me think a lot more about whether we should judge an artwork purely based on what we see in front of us – the materials and the emotions we feel in that first instinctive moment we see it in the gallery –, or whether we should read up about the artwork and the context in which it was made before passing judgement and making comments. And how exactly do statements made by the artist influence our opinion of their work? Which version of the work do we ultimately buy into – our very first impression, or the one we might form at a later stage? Because I can only say that my opinion of Emin’s *My Bed* changed as a result of reading into the wider context.

### Changing attitudes?
This discussion becomes all the more interesting when we reflect on how people receive *My Bed* in 2020, compared to when it was first displayed in 1998. According to Emin, people readily criticised the work twenty years ago, but they seem to take it much more seriously today. Perhaps this comes with a change in society’s attitude towards mental health, a subject that it very closely related to Emin’s bed and the depression she experienced during those bed-ridden days. The stigma surrounding mental health has been steadily decreasing over the years, and there are generally greater levels of openness around this subject. And with that, comes perhaps a softer approach to the raw depiction of depression and failure, as captured so perfectly by Tracey Emin’s *My Bed*.

By continuing to exhibit Emin’s bed, we are required to continue thinking about mental health, and the ‘stains’ in peoples’ lives, as Emin calls them. The installation also invites us to consider more deeply our changing relationship with an artwork. From the perspective of advocating truth in art, be it confessional or not, I do admire what Emin has achieved with this personal and honest work. However, on reflection, I can’t say that I support the context in which this piece is presented and received – some of Emin’s comments about the installation, her pairing of this work with works by other artists, and the sheer amount of attention it has been given over the years.

Every time I look at *My Bed*, I feel something different about it; it’s a complicated relationship.
