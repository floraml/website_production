The well-established gallery tour programme at Tate Modern and Tate Britain invites people to engage with a diverse and extensive range of art from the past to the present day. For first-time visitors and regular museum goers, the 45 minute guided tour becomes a platform for developing new interests and for engaging in dynamic discussions, which evolve in accordance with the background and unique stories of the tour guide, as well as the responses of tour participants.

I have been a gallery guide at Tate Modern since November 2019, and am thoroughly enjoying the opportunity to explore artworks I know, as well as those unfamiliar to me. The chance to share my interest and knowledge of art history with fellow Tate guides and audiences, and to gain new perspectives on artworks, has heightened my appreciation of the reciprocal joys of art.
	
My role as Tate guide – to inspire visitors who are not necessarily art experts, avid museum or gallery-goers – involves the facilitation of active audience discussion and involvement, rather than simply communicating basic facts or background knowledge. It is sometimes a challenge to reassure and involve those who are nervous to contribute their opinions. One of my personal aims is to negate the preconception that modern art is ‘impossible to understand’, as well as the common belief that you need to understand the meaning of an artwork in order to enjoy it. 

In my opinion, enjoying artwork relies quite simply on your ability to unlock pleasure in the colours, shapes, lines and spirit of the artwork – and little more than that. Through finding a personal connection with an object, film or painting – whether it reminds you of a person, place or material, you should find greater value in the artwork you are looking at.
	
I am enclosing the gallery notes for my original tour of the ‘Media Networks’ gallery in Tate Modern, Level 4, which explores how artists in Tate’s collection have responded to the impact of mass media. My tour focuses on the value of sight and sound in three selected artworks: a print, film and installation.

### Gallery Notes - Tate Modern, Level 4

Overall theme: How technology in art helps us better understand the world and objects around us – either through the choice of artistic materials or by encouraging the audience to tap into their senses (sight and sounds) in more inventive ways.

#### Franciszka Themerson, Stefan Themerson, Frame from The Eye and the Ear, 1945, printed c.1950s–1970s

-	Polish couple: lived in Poland during 1930s and emigrated to the UK in 1940s following the German invasion of France in 1940.
-	Franciszka was principally a painter, Stefan a writer. They experimented with photography in the 1920s and spent much of the 1930s making experimental films in Poland.
-	Photography was full of experimentation after WWII, celebrated as the fastest, most modern, and technologically advanced means of representing the world.
-	The Themersons questioned how far they could push technology, joining Man Ray and Pablo Picasso in removing the camera to capture the spirit of the depicted object.
-	This work looks photographic, but the camera doesn’t ‘do much work’. It is based on the same principles as the photogram: the print consists of light, liquid and random found objects. We don’t see the objects, but the empty shadows or traces they leave behind. The print captures the stillness of that particular moment.
-	Freud & Surrealism: Freud was similarly interested in finding ‘traces’, which he related to deepest memories and what is ‘uncanny’ or strange in the human psyche. The white, hollow ‘traces’ seen in works by Themerson have a similarly ghostly quality.
-	Introduce sunography, which shares the principles of the photogram.

-	This film incorporates the Themersons’ innovative work with photograms in the 1920s. 
-	Compare the ‘still’ photogram frame to the ‘live’ objects seen on screen here: it is an attempt to bring everyday objects to life. The objects were filmed from the underside of glass shelf, to create ‘photograms in motion’. The hand gains 3D form and a life of its own, as it interacts playfully with the water. 
-	1920/30s filmmakers, including the Themersons, typically rejected mainstream cinema that involved actors or scenarios, to instead focus on the material quality of light. This offered new ways of constructing life after the stagnancy of war; a new energy was found in the moving image. Glamour of movies and cinema culture: dazzling lights of movie theatres in big cities.
-	This film is also an attempt to bring sound to life on screen and create for our eyes an impression comparable with what our eyes experience – moving on from the visually static photograph or photogram.
-	Film soundtrack – four pieces: Polish composers and poem read aloud. Watching the film without listening – do the visual elements give us a good sense of the sound? There seems to be a close affinity between the two:
    - Green words: Intertwining branches – nature poem. Emotional violin sound mirrors the musical crescendo.
    - St Francis: feels more controlled. Symmetry and balance mirrored in the geometric shapes. Visual ‘score’ closely represents the different instruments.
    - Rowan Towers: shapes change height according to the changing pitch.
    - Wanda: story of Polish Queen, who drowned. Mournful music is reflected visually in the restful water and ebbing waves.
-	Abstract films celebrate the rhythms of the moving image + play of light. New form of visual music. Arguably, the new form of music is presented here on screen. 

#### Cildo Meireles, Babel, 2001  

<img src="https://github.com/floraml/filehosting/raw/master/tate/tate5.png" width="300" />

-	Cildo Meireles: Brazilian conceptual artist, artist and sculptor born in 1948. Meireles is especially noted for his political installations – often large and dense in appearance –, which encourage a phenomenological experience through the viewer’s interaction.
-	This large installation, which takes the form of a circular tower made from hundreds of second-hand analogue radios stacked in layers, was made 60 years after the Themersons’ film. Both artists were equally fascinated by the combination of sight and sound, and how sound can be represented through the inventive use of objects.
-	Visual element comes together with sound, like in the Themersons’ film, to show us how sound from objects can take on a new form. Sound becomes almost visible/sculptural.
-	A further comparison: same use of found objects, as seen in the Themersons’ filmwork: Babel was made from hundreds of radios, from old-fashioned radios of the 1920s to contemporary radios of the 21st century.
-	Pay attention to the sounds coming from the radios, and how it feels to stand under the tower. What is the lighting like?
    - Fantastical / sci-fi: transported to another world. Eerie blue light.
    - Different frequencies: creates a cacophony of sounds to confuse visitors.
    - Height of tower and use of perspective: the tower soars upwards, representing the power of technology. Metaphor for artists trying to go higher, to be more creative, and push the boundaries of technology, similar to the Themersons after WWII. We continue to do this in the modern day: AI, mobile phone technology.

-	Meireles and the Themersons seek / sought the most innovative ways of perceiving the world around us: how can we translate the ‘cultural music’ we hear around us on a daily basis (such as at multicultural institutions like Tate Modern, London) into works of art.
