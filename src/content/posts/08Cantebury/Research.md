## Virtual AMPS Canterbury Conference, June 2020

As a core member of Ideal Spaces Working Group – an international arts research group – I was invited to co-write and present a paper at the AMPS Canterbury Conference in June 2020. In response to the interdisciplinary focus of the conference, ‘Connections: Heritage, Architecture, Cities, Art and Media’, we were especially keen to explore ideas ubiquitous across architectural history, sociology and digital technology. Our primary aim was to spark a conversation about the cross-cultural practices of construction today and in the future. With the spectacular, gothic-style Canterbury cathedral in such close proximity to the conference location, it seemed apt to consider the highly influential architecture of this period as a crucial starting point. In the midst of lockdown, the conference proceedings ended up taking place online, although this too was strangely in keeping with our discussion on digital spaces and online applications in the second half of our presentation. 

The video recording of our presentation can be found on YouTube at - [Abstraction and the Gothic Cathedral](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2Ar4kmmvm8).

<u>Abstract</u>

>> If we understand architecture as a physically built space, as well as an architecture of organisation, the gothic cathedral is to be considered a prototype of an organisation-mode, which was coined for the development of our cultural sphere – the so-called Latin West. Furthermore, if we understand abstraction as an active means through which to build an organisation (directly visible or not), then abstraction was a cultural tendency of that Latin West. It led from the gothic cathedral to the digital spaces of today, together with the notions of a cybernetic system and of fractal geometries, the cathedral being a forerunner and the epitome of such a tendency.
>>
>>Despite the apparent differences between the times of the gothic cathedral and today’s abstract digital spaces and network-ideas, there is a common denominator: the search for utopia via the attempt to overcome the confinements of materiality and, more importantly, to arrive at a final state for humanity. In the times of the cathedral, it was the Heavenly Jerusalem located outside earthly belongings; later, it became a modernist dream of Bruno Taut and the _Neues Bauen_ architects; before pouring into the dreams of liberation through immateriality underlying the early days of the Internet. The ‘cyberspace’ of those days was already embedded in the Christian concept of the cathedral, the latter being a symbol for a real state to achieve, together with the eschatological hope to end all history as it was. The basic mindset of construction and its principles remained the same; nevertheless, they had become secular.
