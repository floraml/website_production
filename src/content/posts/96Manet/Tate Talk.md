## Tate Guides Independent Art Group Talks

### Édouard Manet, _A Bar at the Folies-Bergère_, 1882

For the Tate Gallery Guides ‘What’s so special about…?’ July presentation series, I gave a talk on Édouard Manet’s _A Bar at the Folies-Bergère _– one of the most iconic works in the Courtauld Collection and a painting I have visited many times in the Courtauld Gallery. I have enjoyed trying to ‘figure out’ the significance of events unfolding within this striking work, as well as Manet’s complex, and seemingly contradictory, depiction of modernity.

### Manet and Modern Paris

Manet was born into an affluent Parisian family. He refused conventional artistic training at the academy, showing no interest in arduously layering paint like the ‘realist’ painters of this period. The works of Édouard Dantan, for example, reveal a concerted effort to achieve a likeness of the subject matter, to the extent that his paintings gain an almost photographic quality. This is evident in his 1880 painting of the Salon, the official art exhibition of the Académie des Beaux-Arts in Paris, which was a pure celebration of realist works. The Salon goer expected to see artworks that gave an illusion of reality and were ‘easy to read’ – something that Manet denies the viewer in _A Bar at the Folies-Bergère_, in pursuit of a more experimental and innovative style of painting.

Manet was captivated by the dynamism of Paris at the turn of the 20th century, where he observed old conventions of social rank and deference gradually becoming undone. In the 1860s, French administrator Baron Haussmann ordered the medieval parts of the city be knocked down and replaced with the boulevards, parks and theatres that we associate with Paris today. We see in Camille Pissarro’s 1898 painting A_venue de l’Opèra_, pictured below, how Haussmann’s modern urban design brought light and air to the centre of the city. Manet sought to capture this spirit of modern Paris in his paintings. His work reiterates the necessity of engaging with art to understand how the world looked and felt in the past – in this case, the end of the 19th century –, when the urban and social spaces in Paris were undergoing such dramatic transformation.

A _Bar at the Folies-Bergère_ by Manet gives the viewer an authentic glimpse of a vibrant café concert or variety show venue, whose interior was subsequently lost. It was a place of social animation, where people shared political ideas, artists convened, singers and jugglers performed. For Manet, the Folies-Bergère represented the exciting new entertainment spaces that were becoming popular in Paris at the time, particularly amongst the increasingly wealthy, growing middle class, who had leisure time and money to spend. The painting exudes luxury and opulence, depicting glittering chandeliers, a rich, deeply veined marble-top bar surface and decadent items for sale: champagne, wine (with Manet’s signature etched onto the side of the bottle) and candied mandarins in a cut-glass bowl. To the right of the bottle of wine, is a brown bottle with a red triangle on its label – the logo for Bass Brewery –, representing the international audience that would have come to the Folies-Bergère. This was, in fact, the first time that a trademarked logo appeared in a painting.

In the lower half of the painting, the viewer catches a glimpse of the edge of a gold-coloured frame. A female figure, presumably a barmaid, appears to be standing in front of a large mirror, with the frivolous scene and café audience located ‘behind’ us, the viewer. The hustle and bustle of the crowd is depicted in loosely layered brushstrokes – a significant break from traditions in painting at the time – and one that gives the scene a greater sense of energy and movement.

I am drawn to the timelessness of this painting; studying it social scenes, I feel caught between the 19th and 21st centuries. It seems that Manet has perfectly captured the ambivalence of modernity, which is still very much present in the world today. In fact, the painting seems especially relevant in our post-lockdown society, where bars and restaurants face a new set of ‘social rules’. Manet invites us to negotiate modern themes, to think about how entertainment spaces adapt to changing times and unprecedented circumstances, such as those recently brought about by COVID-19. 

### The Primary Theatre of Everyday Life

Have you noticed the legs and little green feet of a trapeze performer that pop out of the frame in the top left hand corner, flying above the main auditorium? There are certainly several spectators in this painting, who are poised and ready for entertainment, such as the lady holding opera glasses. The exuberant image of the American dancer Loie Fuller, pictured below, captures the spirit, sensuality and excitement of performance and cabaret culture of Paris at the turn of the century. Fuller was an important attraction at the Folies-Bergère, as well as at the 1900 Paris world fair; she performed incredible choreography wearing flowing silk costumes, which were illuminated with multi-coloured electric lights. 

Critics have even suggested that _A Bar at the Folies-Bergère_ represents the ‘primary theatre of everyday life’, with Manet exploring on canvas a range of social relationships that existed in the real world. Of course, whilst there were several stages for performance in the Folies-Bergère, it has been suggested that theatre and spectacle is also taking place within the audience: in the act of looking, and being seen.

### Consumer or Consumed?

When _A Bar at the Folies-Bergère_ was first exhibited at the Salon in 1882, it would have been considered an incredibly modern work. Despite the large size of the painting, measuring 96 cm by 1.3m, it does not depict anyone of particular importance – just a humble barmaid. We now know that this barmaid was called Suzon, and that she was working at the Folies-Bergère when she posed for Manet in his studio, where he set up a similar-style bar counter for his model to pose behind.

Critics were most surprised by the barmaid’s expression and have never been able to agree on what emotion she is expressing. Her tired reflection could perhaps be the result of a long day at work. But we might also ask whether her immaculate hair and make up acts as a sort of mask or mechanism for coping in the chaotic modern world, a certain neutral look she feels she ought to present? The barmaid stares outwards in our direction. However, this woman isn’t quite staring or asking us to engage with or look at her. Her blank expression suggests reserved indifference; it is affecting, yet we can’t quite pinpoint why. And so, the game is to make sense of what should be a reciprocal look: is the barmaid withholding a secret, is she waiting?

In an X-ray taken of the canvas, the Conservation Team at the Courtauld discovered that the hands of the barmaid had originally been painted folded across her abdomen. Manet later changed this detail to give the barmaid a more symmetrical and open stance, which in turn accentuated her extremely sinched waist, with her velvet bodice all buttoned up. This hourglass figure was incredibly fashionable at the time, and painters of this era were typically very serious about fashion.

Moreover, by having the barmaid rest her hands on the marble top, Manet was able to expose an indirect nakedness and classlessness, because of course, ladies never went out without their gloves in this period – this remained true up until the 1950s. Her position gives us much greater access to her front, and draws the eye straight to the luminous glow of her flesh. We are immediately drawn into the fantasy of a ‘universal language of pleasure’ at the Folies-Bergère, further complicating the viewer’s relationship to this female figure.

The barmaid is immersed in a scene of consumption, arranged amongst other items to be consumed – the drinks, the mandarins. Is Manet suggesting that she is available for consumption too? There seems to be an ominous undertone, with the painting highlighting not only the glittering charm of Paris, but also its darker underbelly. There was, around this time, a real danger around women who worked at a bar such as the Folies-Bergère, who were quite often prostitutes. We see a closeness and intimacy in the mismatched reflection of the barmaid and a mysterious male figure, with the barmaid leaning in as if she were offering herself to him. The slightly skewed perspective seems to reveal two sides of this woman’s experience in modern Paris; she has a double-personality if you like – that of the flirtatious barmaid immersed in a dynamic social scene, and that of the reserved barmaid who is separated from us, and indeed from modern life.

This painting is so full of contradictions that it is difficult to pinpoint one singular reading of modernity. But maybe this was the point; maybe Manet was simply commenting on the ambiguity of the modern world. _A Bar at the Folies-Bergère_ was the artist’s last major work, made a year before his death, so it is quite possible that the painting served as some sort of farewell to the modern world, or indeed a ‘handover’ to the next generation of artists. The painting certainly caught the attention of Seurat and inspired his highly stylised painting _A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte_, whose rigid ‘cut out’ figures are somewhat reminiscent of Manet’s indifferent barmaid. 

There are multiple stories and perspectives that can be read in _A Bar at the Folies-Bergère_. It frustrates the viewer due to its complexity and ambiguity, but it is for this very reason that it rewards viewing time and time again.
