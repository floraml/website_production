## The Ideal Spaces Podcast

Ideal Spaces Working Group recently launched a new podcast series, in which we discuss the driving forces behind society as it is today: not only the built architectural world we live in, but also the human processes of social imagination that architecture is an expression of. As podcast host, I mediate discussion and invite a new guest to join Ulrich Gehmann, Michael Johannson and I in exploring one of ten vignettes that focuses on an aspect of ‘space’. We discuss topics ranging from managed and functional spaces, to the utopian or dystopian spaces of the imagination. 

### Episode One - Notions of Space

In the first podcast episode, Ulrich, Michael and I explore the question ‘What is Space?’. We introduce the ‘vignette’ concept behind the podcast, the recent work of Ideal Spaces, and delve into ideas relating to the camera, as well as the social impact of Covid-19, 
gaming and virtual conferences.

### Episode Two – Managed Spaces

In Episode 2, the Ideal Spaces team is joined by Professor Kean Birch, Associate Professor in the Faculty of Enivironmental and Urban Change as well as Graduate Program Director of the Science & Technology Studies Program at York University, Canada. Kean’s research focuses on the emergence of a specifically technoscientific capitalism, entailing the increasing entanglement of technoscience and finance. His most recent project focuses on the diverse modes of rentiership in technology sectors, especially in the extraction and exploitation of our personal data, and what this means for the organization of markets and economies. Kean talks to us about the entanglement of space with financial logic, using two key examples of financial or social assets: bio-fuels and houses. We discuss the complex relationship between people and managed spaces, the collection and use of personal data, and the future of management.

## Interview Series 
This new podcast series, of which I am co-host, runs alongside Ideal Spaces’ existing series on 'space'. In a sequence of short interviews, we invite guests to discuss their current project work and current project work. The series is designed to deepen our understanding of the theme Community and Place, which was central to our contribution at the 2020 Future Europe exhibition at the Schusev Museum of Architecture in Moscow.

### Interview with Professor Andy Jones: Urban Parks

Flora Loughridge and Ulrich Gehmann are joined by Andy Jones, Professor in Public Health at UEA’s Norwich Medical School. Andy’s primary research focus is on the environmental influences on population health. His core work explores the manner by which characteristics of the social and physical environments act to influence the health of the population. 
This interview focuses on Andy’s recently published co-authored study on Environmental Equity and Perceived Accessibility to Urban Parks in Osaka, Japan. This opens up a thought-provoking discussion on the history of parks, problems with accessibility and funding of urban parks, as well as the future of green spaces.
<br/>
The study, ‘Quantitative Environmental Equity Analysis of Perceived Accessibility to Urban Parks in Osaka Prefecture, Japan’, was published on October 17, 2020 in the <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12061-020-09360-5"> Journal of Applied Spatial Analysis and Policy.
