## The Ideal Spaces Podcast

Ideal Spaces Working Group recently launched a new podcast series, in which we discuss the driving forces behind society as it is today: not only the built architectural world we live in, but also the human processes of social imagination that architecture is an expression of. As podcast host, I mediate discussion and invite a new guest to join Ulrich Gehmann, Michael Johannson and I in exploring one of ten vignettes that focuses on an aspect of ‘space’. We discuss topics ranging from managed and functional spaces, to the utopian or dystopian spaces of the imagination. 

### Episode One - Notions of Space

In the first of our ten vignettes, Ulrich, Michael and I explore the question ‘What is Space?’. We introduce the ‘vignette’ concept behind the podcast, the recent work of Ideal Spaces, and delve into ideas relating to the camera, as well as the social impact of Covid-19, 
gaming and virtual conferences.

### Episode Two – Managed Spaces

In Episode 2, we are joined by Professor Kean Birch, Associate Professor in the Faculty of Enivironmental and Urban Change as well as Graduate Program Director of the Science & Technology Studies Program at York University, Canada. Kean’s research focuses on the emergence of a specifically technoscientific capitalism, entailing the increasing entanglement of technoscience and finance. His most recent project focuses on the diverse modes of rentiership in technology sectors, especially in the extraction and exploitation of our personal data, and what this means for the organization of markets and economies. Kean talks to us about the entanglement of space with financial logic, using two key examples of financial or social assets: bio-fuels and houses. We discuss the complex relationship between people and managed spaces, the collection and use of personal data, and the future of management.

### Episode Three – Functional Spaces

In Episode 3, the Ideal Spaces team is joined by Stan Allen, an architect and Professor of Architecture at Princeton. Stan holds degrees from Brown University, The Cooper Union and Princeton. In 1991, he established an independent practice, and since that time, has pursued parallel careers as architect, educator and writer. He has taught as Harvard, Columbia and Princeton, and served as Dean of the School of Architecture at Princeton from 2002 to 2012. His books include <i>Points + Lines: Diagrams and Projects for the City</i> (1999); <i>Practice: Architecture, Technique and Representation</i> (2008); <i>Landform Bulding: Architecture's New Terrain</i> (2011); and <i>Stan Allen: Four Projects</i> (2017). His most recent book, published in 2020, is <i>Situated Objects</i>, a book of buildings and projects located in the Hudson River Valley, where Stan lives and works. 

In this episode, we discuss architecture as a material practice that should anticipate and continuously evolve over time, and architecture as the immaterial structures, voids and spaces between things. Finally, we explore the importance of re-connecting architecture with time and process, to once again find a human measure that makes functional spaces sustainable human living environments.

## Interview Series 

### Interview with Professor Andy Jones: Urban Parks

Flora Loughridge and Ulrich Gehmann are joined by Andy Jones, Professor in Public Health at UEA’s Norwich Medical School. Andy’s primary research focus is on the environmental influences on population health. His core work explores the manner by which characteristics of the social and physical environments act to influence the health of the population. 
This interview focuses on Andy’s recently published co-authored study on Environmental Equity and Perceived Accessibility to Urban Parks in Osaka, Japan. This opens up a thought-provoking discussion on the history of parks, problems with accessibility and funding of urban parks, as well as the future of green spaces.

The study, ‘Quantitative Environmental Equity Analysis of Perceived Accessibility to Urban Parks in Osaka Prefecture, Japan’, was published on October 17, 2020 in the <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12061-020-09360-5"> Journal of Applied Spatial Analysis and Policy.</a>

### Interview with Khalid Kadir: Engineering Social Justice

Podcast co-hosts Flora Loughridge and Ulrich Gehmann speak to Dr Khalid Kadir, a Continuing Lecturer at UC Berkeley and recipient of the 2017 Distinguished Teaching Award, UC Berkeley’s most prestigious honor for teaching. In this episode, we discuss the intersection of poverty, engineering expertise and politics, as well as the complex role that expertise plays in the politics of international development and poverty alleviation. Along the way, we talk about everything from social media and Silicon Valley to resilience, utopia and who is accountable for the social injustice in the technology-focused society we have built.⁣
