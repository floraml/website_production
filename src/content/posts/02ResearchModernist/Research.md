A walking tour in glorious sunshine, through some of the greenest spaces in Zehlendorf, Berlin seemed a good way of exploring a few groundbreaking examples of 1920s modern German housing. As I would later learn during my MA course at the Courtauld Institute, the architects of these houses – Walter Gropius and his contemporaries – shared a common goal, gravitating towards the idea of functional, sober-modern and affordable construction, which they placed at the heart of Berlin’s leafy suburbs.

Whilst leaving *Krumme Lanke*, the sleek modernist U-Bahn station designed by Alfred Grenander in 1929, to meet our tour guide, I became aware of the extent to which this ‘streamlined’ modern lifestyle had crept into all aspects of life in southwest Berlin by the end of the 1920s: from housing and transport, to community buildings, hair salons and grocery shops. Modernism also had a resounding influence throughout Europe, and was embraced by Britain during the inter-war period for its rigorous style, minimal ornamentation and emphasis on spatial volume. I noted that the double-height ticket hall and deeply curved station entranceway at *Krumme Lanke* were indeed reminiscent of the architectural style of many of London’s underground stations, such as English architect Charles Holden’s Chiswick Park Station.

Just around the corner in Onkel-Toms-Hütte, a striking modernist housing estate designed by architect and urban planner Bruno Taut in 1926, I observed the delightful muted apple green and dusty blue facades of three-storey family homes. These buildings made a pleasant yet somewhat surprising change from the sleek white facades of the typically ‘modernist’ houses found in the neighbouring Zehlendorf streets. The natural colours echoing the lines of trees and peaceful character of this rural area were a sure indication of how Taut’s Green City Movement achieved unity between nature and urban development.             

Nestled in amongst the pine trees, and partially hidden behind a garden wall, were two buildings that caught my interest: Richard Neutra’s 1923 Zehlendorf Type e houses 85 and 87. Our tour guide informed us that a tripartite revolving stage, known as the *Drehbühne*, was located in the central living area of each of these family homes. At the touch of a button, a hidden stage mechanism would re-orientate the living room towards the dining room, music room or library. I became fascinated by this idea of a live-in domestic ‘stage’, which transformed a household’s daily routine into a dynamic, fast-pace performance. Instead of pursuing a monotonous lifestyle, the inhabitants of these houses were able to determine their own fate, and enjoy a more flexible, spontaneous relationship with domestic space.

Neutra’s innovations in housing reminded me of the new, flexible staging configurations that were emerging in German theatre in the 1920s, namely Walter Gropius’s proposed *Total Theatre* (begun 1926), which, commissioned by director Erwin Piscator, was intended to break down the barrier between actor and audience with its flexible space and innovative design. Actors could select the type of staging that suited their performance requirements, with the traditional proscenium ‘box’ design interchangeable with three configurations: proscenium, box or deep stage. 

There seemed to be a compelling comparison: theatre reflected life in both the architectural designs of the Total Theatre and in Neutra’s revolving stage, which connected modern staging ideas to those of architecture, of spectator to space. I was intrigued by the influence of domestic space on the 1920s homemaker, as well as its related domestic ‘dramas’.
